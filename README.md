## About WooCommerce Northbeam
This plugin connects WooCommerce to Northbeam's Orders API so that the API ingests order data for reporting and analysis. It does this by hooking into the `woocommerce_payment_complete` action, which runs whenever a payment is made for any order. The plugin can also include the Northbeam tracking pixel and the `firePurchaseEvent` script, which runs on the WooCommerce thank you/receipt page. It is compatible with WooCommerce Subscriptions.
